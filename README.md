business_news_tagging
=====================

ruby/sinatra web app to let Business journalists see the results of their content tagging

http://business-news-tagging.herokuapp.com/

data is pulled from the live linked data platform so the app needs a whitelisted cert 
(by default it will look for a local dir ./dependencies/cert.pem)
